📝 This plugin for TiddlyWiki 2.x shows when there are unsaved changes or (optionally) tiddlers opened for editing.

When unsaved, marks "save" button bold red (by default; styles can be adjusted via StyleSheetUnsaved)
and adds a leading `*` to the document title.

🛍️ Available to install via [ExtensionsExplorerPlugin](https://github.com/YakovL/TiddlyWiki_ExtensionsExplorerPlugin), like many others (to find it, install the central collection and YLExtensionsCollection from it).
